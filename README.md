Google University Outreach Quicksite
===============

The inspiration was wearables such as Google Glass where the interface can be interacted with yet still remain out of the way. We aim to first penetrate the market by getting early adopters with a dual display setup, as the first version would be ideal for them. We are especially proud of the way we pull from different APIs to give information to our end user at a moment's notice.
