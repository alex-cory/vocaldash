ng-twitter [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-twitter.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ng-twitter) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/ng-twitter.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/ng-twitter)
=====================

Angular directive tweets display.

Idea is to provide a tweet listing for you website.

I have made some tests using angular `http` service to query Twitter API (authentication, query) and it works. But at the end
, I have faced CORS issues, and it was just working on localhost.

So one thing you need to do on your own is the server side.

Demo
-------------

http://darul75.github.io/ng-twitter/

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-twitter
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note `sanitize` module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-twitter.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-twitter.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngTwitter` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngTwitter']);
```

and then just add an `div` with `tweets` directive name attribute, `hashtag` scope variable attribute.

```html
<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" button="true" count="15" refresh="60"/>
```

'hashtag' is your default hashtag search value.

```javascript
$scope.hashtag = 'football';
```

### Attribute

* `hashtag`: scope hashtag string variable object, default 'football'
* `button`: show refresh button, default true
* `hash`: show hash input field, default true
* `count`: number of tweets to show, default 15
* `refresh`: refresh time in seconds

Example with all above features:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="ctrl">
	<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" hash="true" button="true" count="5" refresh="10"/>
</div>
```

### Customization

If you look at the code, module provide one angular service, here is the service side call with `$http`. So, for your needs, just play with it.
```javascript
// TWEETER PROXY SERVICE
.service('twitter', ['$http', function (http) {                        
	return {
	        asyncSearch: function(hashtag, since) {
	                var cfg = {        };
	                var paramSince = since ? '&since_id='+ since : '';
	                // should add 'since' but not there because of mock
	                //var queryUrl = '/search?hashtag='+hashtag+paramSince;
	                
	                // YOUR SERVICE CALL : manage auth and search on server side
	                var queryUrl = '/search?hashtag='+hashtag;
	                var promise = http.get(queryUrl, cfg).then(function (response) {
	                        return response;
	                });
	                return promise;
	        }
	};
}])
```

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
